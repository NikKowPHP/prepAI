# Emergency Fix Plan

## Diagnosis
The original NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md signal file was not saved to disk, preventing proper error diagnosis. The project_manifest.json lacks architectural_map data needed for targeted code searches.

## Fix Steps
1. Implement file persistence checks for all signal files
2. Enhance project_manifest.json with architectural_map data
3. Add automated tests for signal file handling
4. Monitor system for recurrence of this issue

## Implementation Notes
- File persistence should be verified after creation
- Architectural_map should include key components and relationships
- Add error logging for file operations
