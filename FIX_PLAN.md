# Fix Plan for Failing API Tests

## Problem Diagnosis
The test failures in `route.test.ts` are caused by:
1. Duplicate mock implementations of `NextResponse`
2. Improper handling of the `response.json()` method in tests

## Steps to Fix

1. **Remove duplicate NextResponse mock**  
   Remove the second mock implementation (lines 26-34) from `route.test.ts` since it conflicts with the first mock.

2. **Fix the response.json() handling**  
   Update the existing mock to properly handle `response.json()` calls by returning a promise that resolves with the data.

3. **Simplify test setup**  
   Remove the redundant import of `NextResponse` at line 24.

4. **Update test assertions**  
   Modify tests to directly check the response status and data without relying on the mock implementation details.

## Verification
After making these changes, run the tests again to ensure they pass:
```bash
cd prepai
npm test
```

## Implementation Details
The complete fix will be implemented in the next step by modifying `route.test.ts`.
