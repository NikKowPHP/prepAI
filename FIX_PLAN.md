# Prisma CLI Access Resolution

## Problem Analysis
The `prisma` CLI command is unavailable in the current environment due to:
- Restriction on running `npm install`
- Local package binaries not being in system PATH

## Solution
Use `npx` to execute the locally installed Prisma CLI without global installation.

### Steps for Developer
1. Replace all `prisma` commands with `npx prisma` in your workflow
   ```bash
   # Instead of:
   prisma generate
   
   # Use:
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. For verification, run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma --version
   ```
   This should output the Prisma version (v6.9.0) confirming correct access

### Technical Explanation
- `npx` executes binaries from `node_modules/.bin/`
- No global installation required
- Works within environment restrictions

## Verification Method
The developer can verify by:
1. Running `npx prisma generate` successfully
2. Checking for generated Prisma client files in `node_modules/.prisma/client`

## Fallback Option
If issues persist, use direct Node.js execution:
```bash
node node_modules/prisma/build/index.js generate
