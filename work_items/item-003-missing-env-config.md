# Missing Environment Variable Configuration

## Description
The Supabase URL and Anon Key are not defined in environment variables, causing test failures and runtime errors. This violates the system architecture specification which requires proper configuration management.

## Impact
- Tests cannot run successfully
- Application cannot connect to Supabase services
- Violates separation of concerns principle from the canonical spec

## Required Solution
1. Create `.env` file with template for required variables
2. Add Supabase URL and Anon Key to CI/CD pipeline environment
3. Update documentation with configuration instructions
4. Modify test setup to handle environment variables properly
