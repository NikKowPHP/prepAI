# Audit Failure Report

## Missing Core Functionality
The following critical features from the specification appear unimplemented based on static analysis:

1. **User Authentication**
   - No evidence of sign up, sign in, or sign out functionality
   - Required by: docs/canonical_spec.md (Section 2: Functional Requirements)

2. **Interview Topic Selection**
   - No implementation found for role selection or interview prep objectives
   - Required by: docs/canonical_spec.md (Section 2: Functional Requirements)

3. **AI Question Generation**
   - No implementation found for context-aware question generation
   - Required by: docs/canonical_spec.md (Section 2: Functional Requirements)

## Recommended Actions
1. Implement authentication system using NextAuth or similar
2. Create topic selection interface and objective tracking
3. Develop question generation service with AI integration
4. Re-run implementation and audit cycle after completion
