# Audit Failure: SRS Mode Implementation Gaps

## Gap Analysis
The implementation does not fully meet the SRS mode requirements specified in `docs/canonical_spec.md`:

1. **Incomplete Mode Filtering**:
   - Repeat mode missing struggle-based prioritization ([`scheduler.ts:5688`](src/lib/scheduler.ts:5688))
   - Study mode lacks proper time-based decay implementation
   - Discover mode missing AI-generated question integration

2. **Knowledge Gap Analysis**:
   - Current implementation uses basic heuristic instead of AI analysis ([`assessment.ts:4380`](src/lib/assessment.ts:4380))
   - No integration with topic relationship modeling

3. **Struggle Tracking**:
   - Metrics not fully utilized in scheduling decisions ([`srs.ts:6689`](src/lib/srs.ts:6689))
   - UI doesn't reflect real-time struggle metrics

4. **Test Coverage**:
   - Missing tests for mode-specific edge cases ([`srsModes.test.ts:1379`](src/lib/__tests__/srsModes.test.ts:1379))
   - No integration tests for full SRS workflow

## Required Fixes
1. Implement complete mode filtering per specification:
   - Repeat: Questions with ease < 2.0 OR overdue OR high struggle
   - Study: New questions + recent questions (<=3 reviews)
   - Discover: AI-generated questions + topic-related questions

2. Integrate AI-powered knowledge gap analysis:
   - Connect Discover mode to question generation API
   - Implement topic relationship modeling

3. Enhance struggle tracking:
   - Factor struggle metrics into scheduling algorithms
   - Add real-time struggle visualization in UI

4. Complete test coverage:
   - Add tests for all mode filtering scenarios
   - Create end-to-end SRS workflow tests
