## Refactoring Needed: Tests Deletion

The commit deleted the test file `src/app/api/questions/route.test.ts` without replacing it with equivalent tests. This is a serious regression in test coverage.

### Required Actions:
1. Re-implement unit tests for all CRUD operations in the questions API
2. Ensure tests cover all edge cases and error scenarios
3. Maintain at least the same level of test coverage as before the deletion
4. Add new tests for the additional CRUD operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)

### Implementation Guidance:
- Recreate the test file with Jest tests for each endpoint
- Cover authentication, validation, and database interaction scenarios
- Use the existing test patterns as a reference for implementation
- Ensure tests run successfully with `npm test -- --watchAll=false`

Please address these issues before resubmitting for review.
