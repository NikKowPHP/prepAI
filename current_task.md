# Current Task: Re-implement Unit Tests for Questions API

## Task Description
Re-implement the unit tests for all CRUD operations in the questions API that were deleted in the previous commit.

## Steps

1. **Create a new test file**: Create `src/app/api/questions/route.test.ts`
2. **Implement tests for each CRUD operation**:
   - POST: Test creation of new questions
   - GET: Test retrieval of questions (both list and single)
   - PUT: Test updating existing questions
   - DELETE: Test deletion of questions
3. **Cover edge cases and error scenarios**:
   - Authentication errors
   - Validation errors
   - Database errors
4. **Ensure tests run successfully**: Verify with `npm test -- --watchAll=false`

## Implementation Details

- Use Jest for testing
- Mock Prisma and Supabase dependencies
- Follow the same test patterns as the deleted tests
- Ensure 100% coverage of the API endpoints
