# End-to-End Testing

## Objective
To ensure the AI-driven interview preparation system works correctly by implementing comprehensive end-to-end testing.

## Scope
The end-to-end testing will focus on:
- User flows
- Integration testing
- Functional testing
- Regression testing

## Implementation Plan

### 1. User Flows
- **Authentication:** Test user login, registration, and password recovery
- **Question Management:** Test question creation, editing, and deletion
- **Progress Tracking:** Test progress tracking and reporting
- **Report Generation:** Test PDF report generation

### 2. Integration Testing
- **API Integration:** Test API endpoints and responses
- **Database Integration:** Test database operations and data integrity
- **Third-Party Services:** Test integration with third-party services

### 3. Functional Testing
- **UI Components:** Test all UI components for correct functionality
- **Form Validation:** Test form validation and error handling
- **Accessibility:** Test accessibility features

### 4. Regression Testing
- **Automated Tests:** Implement automated regression tests
- **Test Suite:** Create a comprehensive test suite
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Steps
1. **Identify User Flows:**
   - Map out all user flows and interactions
   - Prioritize critical paths for testing

2. **Implement Integration Tests:**
   - Write tests for API endpoints
   - Test database operations
   - Test third-party service integrations

3. **Implement Functional Tests:**
   - Test all UI components
   - Test form validation
   - Test accessibility features

4. **Set Up Regression Testing:**
   - Implement automated regression tests
   - Create a comprehensive test suite
   - Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline

5. **Test and Measure:**
   - Execute all tests
   - Analyze test results
   - Fix any issues and re-test
