# CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

## Objective
To ensure smooth deployment of the AI-driven interview preparation system by implementing a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline configuration.

## Scope
The CI/CD pipeline will focus on:
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Automated Testing
- Deployment Automation

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Continuous Integration
- **Version Control:** Integrate with version control system
- **Build Automation:** Set up automated builds
- **Code Quality:** Implement code quality checks

### 2. Continuous Deployment
- **Deployment Automation:** Automate deployment process
- **Environment Management:** Manage different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- **Rollback Mechanism:** Implement rollback mechanism

### 3. Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Integrate unit tests
- **Integration Tests:** Integrate integration tests
- **End-to-End Tests:** Integrate end-to-end tests

### 4. Deployment Automation
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Use infrastructure as code tools
- **Configuration Management:** Manage configurations
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for deployments

## Implementation Steps
