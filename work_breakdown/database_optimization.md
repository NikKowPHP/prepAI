# Database Optimization

## Objective
To improve the performance of the AI-driven interview preparation system by optimizing database queries and indexing.

## Scope
The optimization will focus on:
- Query performance
- Indexing strategies
- Database schema optimization
- Caching frequently accessed data

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Query Performance
- **Analyze Slow Queries:** Identify and optimize slow-performing queries
- **Query Refactoring:** Refactor complex queries for better performance
- **Batch Processing:** Implement batch processing for bulk operations

### 2. Indexing Strategies
- **Primary Keys:** Ensure all tables have appropriate primary keys
- **Secondary Indexes:** Add indexes to frequently queried fields
- **Composite Indexes:** Create composite indexes for multi-field queries

### 3. Database Schema Optimization
- **Normalization:** Ensure database is properly normalized
- **Denormalization:** Denormalize where appropriate for performance
- **Table Partitioning:** Implement table partitioning for large tables

### 4. Caching Frequently Accessed Data
- **Query Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- **Result Caching:** Cache query results with appropriate expiration
- **Materialized Views:** Use materialized views for complex queries

## Implementation Steps
1. **Analyze Current Queries:**
   - Use database profiling tools to identify slow queries
   - Analyze query execution plans

2. **Add Indexes:**
   - Add indexes to frequently queried fields
   - Create composite indexes for multi-field queries

3. **Optimize Schema:**
   - Ensure proper normalization
   - Denormalize where appropriate
   - Implement table partitioning for large tables

4. **Implement Caching:**
   - Set up query caching for frequently accessed data
   - Use materialized views for complex queries

5. **Test and Measure:**
   - Use performance testing tools to measure improvements
   - Gather feedback and make further optimizations
