# Monitoring and Alerting Configuration

## Objective
To ensure smooth deployment of the AI-driven interview preparation system by implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting configuration.

## Scope
The monitoring and alerting configuration will focus on:
- System Monitoring
- Application Monitoring
- Alerting
- Incident Response

## Implementation Plan

### 1. System Monitoring
- **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- **Log Management:** Implement centralized log management
- **Performance Metrics:** Track key performance metrics

### 2. Application Monitoring
- **Application Health:** Monitor application health and availability
- **Transaction Tracing:** Implement transaction tracing
- **Error Tracking:** Track and monitor errors

### 3. Alerting
- **Threshold Alerts:** Set up threshold alerts for critical metrics
- **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection
- **Notification Channels:** Configure notification channels (email, SMS, etc.)

### 4. Incident Response
- **Response Plan:** Develop an incident response plan
- **On-Call Rotation:** Set up on-call rotation
- **Post-Mortems:** Implement post-mortem analysis for incidents

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up System Monitoring:**
   - Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
   - Implement centralized log management
   - Track key performance metrics

2. **Implement Application Monitoring:**
   - Monitor application health and availability
   - Implement transaction tracing
   - Track and monitor errors

3. **Configure Alerting:**
   - Set up threshold alerts for critical metrics
   - Implement anomaly detection
   - Configure notification channels

4. **Develop Incident Response:**
   - Create an incident response plan
   - Set up on-call rotation
   - Implement post-mortem analysis for incidents

5. **Test and Measure:**
   - Test monitoring and alerting system
   - Simulate incidents to verify monitoring
   - Adjust and optimize based on testing
