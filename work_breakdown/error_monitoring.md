# Error Monitoring

## Objective
To ensure the AI-driven interview preparation system is reliable by implementing comprehensive error monitoring.

## Scope
The error monitoring will focus on:
- Error tracking
- Log management
- Alerting
- Incident response

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Error Tracking
- **Error Reporting:** Implement error reporting tools
- **Stack Traces:** Capture stack traces for errors
- **User Impact:** Track user impact of errors

### 2. Log Management
- **Centralized Logging:** Implement centralized logging
- **Log Rotation:** Set up log rotation
- **Log Analysis:** Implement log analysis tools

### 3. Alerting
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Set up real-time alerts for critical errors
- **Threshold Alerts:** Set up threshold alerts for error rates
- **Notification Channels:** Configure notification channels (email, SMS, etc.)

### 4. Incident Response
- **Response Plan:** Develop an incident response plan
- **On-Call Rotation:** Set up on-call rotation
- **Post-Mortems:** Implement post-mortem analysis for incidents

## Implementation Steps
1. **Implement Error Tracking:**
   - Integrate error reporting tools
   - Capture stack traces for errors
   - Track user impact of errors

2. **Set Up Log Management:**
   - Implement centralized logging
   - Set up log rotation
   - Implement log analysis tools

3. **Configure Alerting:**
   - Set up real-time alerts for critical errors
   - Set up threshold alerts for error rates
   - Configure notification channels

4. **Develop Incident Response:**
   - Create an incident response plan
   - Set up on-call rotation
   - Implement post-mortem analysis for incidents

5. **Test and Measure:**
   - Test error monitoring system
   - Simulate errors to verify monitoring
   - Adjust and optimize based on testing
