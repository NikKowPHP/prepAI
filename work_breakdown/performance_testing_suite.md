# Performance Testing Suite

## Objective
To ensure the AI-driven interview preparation system performs efficiently by implementing a comprehensive performance testing suite.

## Scope
The performance testing suite will focus on:
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Scalability testing
- Resource utilization

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Load Testing
- **Simulate Users:** Simulate multiple users accessing the system simultaneously
- **Response Times:** Measure response times under load
- **Throughput:** Test system throughput under load

### 2. Stress Testing
- **Maximum Load:** Test system behavior under maximum load
- **Breaking Point:** Identify system breaking points
- **Recovery:** Test system recovery after stress

### 3. Scalability Testing
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Test system performance with additional servers
- **Vertical Scaling:** Test system performance with increased resources
- **Auto-Scaling:** Implement and test auto-scaling policies

### 4. Resource Utilization
- **CPU Usage:** Monitor CPU usage under load
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor memory usage under load
- **Disk I/O:** Monitor disk I/O under load
- **Network I/O:** Monitor network I/O under load

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up Load Testing:**
   - Use tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling
   - Simulate multiple users
   - Measure response times and throughput

2. **Implement Stress Testing:**
   - Test system under maximum load
   - Identify breaking points
   - Test system recovery

3. **Conduct Scalability Testing:**
   - Test horizontal scaling with additional servers
   - Test vertical scaling with increased resources
   - Implement and test auto-scaling policies

4. **Monitor Resource Utilization:**
   - Set up monitoring for CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network I/O
   - Analyze resource usage under load
   - Optimize resource usage as needed

5. **Test and Measure:**
   - Execute all performance tests
   - Analyze test results
   - Optimize system performance based on test results
