# Performance Optimization

## Objective
To improve the performance of the AI-driven interview preparation system by implementing code splitting, lazy loading, and other optimization techniques.

## Scope
The optimization will focus on:
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Database query optimization
- Caching mechanisms
- Bundle size reduction

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- **Dynamic Imports:** Use Next.js dynamic import for code splitting
- **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for components and routes
- **Optimize Imports:** Ensure only necessary modules are imported

### 2. Database Query Optimization
- **Indexing:** Add appropriate indexes to frequently queried fields
- **Query Optimization:** Optimize database queries for performance
- **Caching:** Implement query caching for frequently accessed data

### 3. Caching Mechanisms
- **HTTP Caching:** Implement appropriate HTTP caching headers
- **Server-Side Caching:** Use Redis or similar for server-side caching
- **Client-Side Caching:** Implement client-side caching strategies

### 4. Bundle Size Reduction
- **Tree-Shaking:** Use Webpack's tree-shaking to remove unused code
- **Minification:** Ensure all code is minified for production
- **Asset Optimization:** Optimize images and other assets

## Implementation Steps
1. **Implement Code Splitting:**
   - Use dynamic import for large components and routes
   - Ensure critical code is loaded first

2. **Optimize Database Queries:**
   - Add indexes to frequently queried fields
   - Optimize query performance

3. **Add Caching Mechanisms:**
   - Implement HTTP caching headers
   - Set up server-side caching with Redis

4. **Reduce Bundle Size:**
   - Enable tree-shaking in Webpack
   - Minify all code for production
   - Optimize images and assets

5. **Test and Measure:**
   - Use performance testing tools to measure improvements
   - Gather feedback and make further optimizations
