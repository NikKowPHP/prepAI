# SRS Implementation Plan

## Core Functionality
- Repeat mode algorithm
- Study mode algorithm
- Discover mode algorithm
- Scheduling logic

## Implementation Tasks
1. [ ] (LOGIC) Implement Repeat mode selection criteria (low ease factor, overdue)
2. [ ] (LOGIC) Implement Study mode selection criteria (new questions, few reviews)
3. [ ] (LOGIC) Implement Discover mode selection criteria (unseen questions)
4. [ ] (LOGIC) Create SRS scheduling algorithm
5. [ ] (UI) Build mode selection interface
6. [ ] (UI) Create progress visualization for each mode
7. [ ] (LOGIC) Implement ease factor calculation
8. [ ] (LOGIC) Develop review interval adjustment
9. [ ] (LOGIC) Create question difficulty tracking
10. [ ] (UI) Add mode-specific feedback mechanisms

## Dependencies
- Question generation service
- User progress tracking
